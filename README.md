===============
Mini-IDE / play ground for Lasso 9.
Functional, but not ready for prime time.

Pre Release Notes
-----------------
1. Edit settings in the index.lasso file
2. Currently does not work as a lassoapp
3. Currently requires a local MySQL installation (no sqlite)
4. It has ZERO security on it â€” do NOT install this on anything other than a local box (!)
5. There's a number of quirks, some of the code editor behaviour needs to be improved other things just don't work.

Pre Release Goals
-----------------
1. Implement actual native Lasso mode
2. Allow switching between modes
3. Improve code editing to handle brackets etc better.
4. Enable the history functionality
5. Check box for auto running
6. Allow actual files and folders to be opened and editored.
7. The list goes on....
